            " the interplay of the tetragonality of the alloy , band filling , hybridization between the constituents affect certainly the magnitude of the mae . \n",
            " for instance , tetragonality leads to the lifting of the degeneracy of the electrons by the tetragonal crystal field and produces thereby an additional contribution to the mae . \n",

            " copt binary bulk alloy in the * l1@xmath0 * structure ( see fig.[cell_bulk ] ) is by now a classical example of a material exhibiting a large perpendicular mae , around 1 mev  @xcite . \n",

            " the interplay of the tetragonality of the alloy , band filling , hybridization between the constituents affect certainly the magnitude of the mae . \n",
            " for instance , tetragonality leads to the lifting of the degeneracy of the electrons by the tetragonal crystal field and produces thereby an additional contribution to the mae . \n",
            " thus , and as expected from perturbation theory , the mae becomes proportional to @xmath1 instead of @xmath2 as found for cubic symmetry , where @xmath3 is the spin - orbit coupling constant . \n",

            " sakuma@xcite shows that by changing the axial ratio ( c / a ) defining the tetragonality of copt and fept alloys , the mae first smoothly decreases by increasing c / a till reaching a minimum at @xmath40.8 before a smooth increase in magnitude . \n",
            " interestingly , except a small window of axial ratios ( @xmath5 ) , the mae favors an out - of - plane orientation of the magnetic moments . \n",
            " the tetragonalization is then thought to provide an effect similar to the band filling@xcite .    in the context of thin films , \n",
            " zhang et al.@xcite demonstrated with ab - initio simulations that for copt films terminated by co layers , a thickness of at least 9 monolayers exhibit a rather converged mae , with a bulk contribution of 1.36 mev favoring a perpendicular orientation of the magnetic moments and a counter - acting surface contribution of -0.76 mev favoring , interestingly , an in - plane orientation of the moments . \n",

            " , nnms can exist in the mechanical systems with rather specific interparticle interactions , for example , in systems whose potential energy represents a _ homogeneous _ function with respect to all its arguments . \n",
            " however , in some cases , the existence of nnms is caused by certain symmetry - related reasons . \n",
            " we refer to such dynamical objects as _ symmetry - determined _ nnms .    in  @xcite \n",
            " , we have found all symmetry - determined nnms in all @xmath1-particle mechanical systems with any of 230 space groups . \n",
            " this proved to be possible due to the group - theoretical methods developed in  @xcite for constructing _ bushes _ of vibrational modes .    at this point \n",

            " such bushes have been discussed in  @xcite . \n",
            " let us reproduce here some ideas and results from these papers . \n",
            " every bush b@xmath11 $ ] describes a certain vibrational regime , and some specific _ pattern _ of instantaneous displacements of all the particles of the mechanical system corresponds to it . in turn , this pattern is characterized by a symmetry group @xmath12 ( in particular , such group can be trivial ) which is a _ subgroup _ of the symmetry group @xmath13 of the mechanical system in its equilibrium state . \n",
            " for example , let us consider the _ two - dimensional _ bush b@xmath14 $ ] in the monoatomic chain with periodic boundary conditions whose displacement pattern @xmath15 can be written as follows @xmath16 this pattern is determined by two time - dependent functions @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and the corresponding _ vibrational state _ of the @xmath1-particle chain is fully described by displacements inside the _ primitive cell _ , which is four time larger than that of the equilibrium state . \n",

            " the combination of ease and fast pace of sharing information provides a fertile breeding ground for rumours , false- and disinformation . \n",
            " social media users tend to share controversial information in - order to verify it , while asking about for the opinions of their followers ( zhao et . \n",

            "black hole candidates ( bhcs ) are characterized by rapid x - ray variability ( see recent reviews by van der klis 1995 and cui 1999a ) . \n",
            " it is also common for bhcs that the variability at high energies lags behind that at low energies ( cui 1999a and references therein ) , which is often referred to as hard lag . \n",
            " the hard lag is often attributed to thermal inverse - comptonization processes ( e.g. , miyatomo et al . \n",
            " 1988 ; hua & titarchuk 1996 ; kazanas et al . 1997 ; bttcher & liang 1998 ; hua et al . \n",
            " 1999 ) , which are generally thought to be responsible for producing the characteristic hard tail in the x - ray spectra of bhcs ( tanaka & lewin 1995 ) . in these models , \n",
            " the hard lag arises simply because a greater number of scatterings are required for seed photons to reach higher energies . \n",
            " therefore , the lag is directly related to the diffusion timescale through the comptonizing region , which scales logarithmically with photon energy ( e.g. , payne 1980 ; hua & titarchuk 1996 ) . \n",
            " the expected logarithmic energy - dependence of the hard lag is in rough agreement with the observations ( cui et al . \n",
            " 1997 ; crary et al . 1998 \n",
            " ; nowak et al . 1999 ) . however , the measured lag is often large ( e.g. , a few tenths of a second ) at low frequencies , which would require a very extended comptonizing region ( kazanas et al . \n",
            " 1997 ; bttcher & liang 1998 ; hua et al . \n",
            " it is not clear whether such a region can be physically maintained ( nowak et al . \n",

            " suggestions have also be made to link the hard lag either to the propagation or drift time scale of waves or blobs of matter through an increasingly hotter region toward the central black hole where hard x - rays are emitted ( miyamoto et al . \n",
            " 1988 ; kato 1989 ; bttcher & liang 1999 ) or to the evolution time scale of magnetic flares ( poutanen & fabian 1999 ) . regardless which scenario turns out to be close to reality , it is clear that the hard lag is an important property of bhcs which we can use to gain insight into the geometry and dynamics of accretion flows in these systems . \n",
            " recently , however , it was discovered that a strong qpo in grs 1915 + 105 , a well - known microquasar , had a rather complex pattern of phase lag ( cui 1999b ) : while the hard lag was measured for the odd harmonics of the signal , the even harmonics displayed _ soft _ lag . \n",
            " the pattern is puzzling because it does not fit naturally into any of the models suggested for bhcs . \n",
            " speculation was made that the complicated qpo lag in this case might be caused by a change in the form of the wave that produced the qpo ( cui 1999b ) . \n",
            " it is , however , not clear what physical mechanisms could be responsible for such evolution of the wave form . \n",
            " similar behavior was subsequently observed for some of the qpos in xte j1550 - 564 ( wijnands et al . \n",

            " a related timing property to the phase lag is the coherence function between two different energy bands . only recently , \n",
            " however , enough attention is paid to the importance of this property ( vaughan & nowak 1997 ) and efforts are made to compute it along with the phase lag . \n",
            " consequently , the results are very limited . \n",
            " it is nevertheless interesting to note that for bhcs the coherence function often appears to be around unity over a wide frequency range  the x - ray variabilities in different energy bands are almost perfectly linearly correlated on those timescales in fourier domain ( vaughan & nowak 1997 ; cui et al . \n",

            "three - dimensional fluid dynamic simulations of turbulent convection in an oxygen - burning shell of a presupernova star show bursty fluctuations which are not seen in one - dimensional stellar evolutionary calculations ( which use various versions of mixing - length theory , mlt , @xcite ) . \n",
            " this paper explores the underlying physics of this new phenomena .    since the formulation of mlt @xcite , \n",
            " there have been a number of significant developments in the theoretical understanding of turbulent convective flow . \n",
            " first , @xcite and @xcite developed the modern version of the turbulent cascade , and published in journals easily accessible in the west ; the original theory @xcite was not used in mlt although it pre - dated it . this explicit expression for dissipation of turbulent velocities , \n",
            " @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the root - mean - square of the turbulent velocity and @xmath3 is the dissipation length . \n",
            " it is found both experimentally and numerically that @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the depth of the convective zone . \n",
            " simulations for low - mach number flow show that the average of this dissipation over the convective zone closely compensates for the corresponding average of the buoyant power @xcite . \n",
            " this additional constraint allows an alternative to present practice : fixing the free parameter ( e.g. , the mixing length factor @xmath6 ) directly by terrestrial experiments and numerical simulations which deal with the process of turbulence itself @xcite , instead of calibrating it from complex astronomical systems ( stellar atmospheres ) as is now done . \n",
            " second , there has been a considerable development in understanding the nature of chaotic behavior in nonlinear systems ; see @xcite for a review and reprints of original papers , and @xcite . \n",
            " @xcite presented a simplified solution to the rayleigh problem of thermal convection @xcite which captured the seed of chaos in the lorenz attractor , and contains a representation of the fluctuating aspect of turbulence not present in mlt . \n",
            " this advance was allowed by the steady increase in computer power and accessibility , which lead to the exploration of solutions for simple systems of nonlinear differential equations ( see @xcite and references therein ) . \n",
            " it became clear that the landau picture @xcite of the approach to turbulence was incorrect both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite . \n",
            " a striking feature of these advances has been the use of simple mathematical models , which capture the essence of chaos in a model with much reduced dimensionality compared to the physical system of interest . \n",
            " third , it has become possible to simulate turbulence on computers . \n",
            " this realizes the vision of john von neumann @xcite , in which numerical solutions of the navier - stokes equations by computer are used to inform mathematical analysis of turbulence . in this paper \n",
            " we will follow this idea of von neumann , in the style which proved successful for chaos studies : building simple mathematical models of a more complex physical system ( in this case , the numerical simulations of turbulent convection ) . \n",
            " this approach should lead to algorithms suitable for implementation into stellar evolution codes , which , unlike mlt , are ( 1 ) based upon solutions to fluid dynamics equations , ( 2 ) non - local , ( 3 ) time - dependent , and ( 4 ) falsifiable by terrestrial experiment and future improved simulations . \n",
            " our particular example is a set of simulations of oxygen burning in a shell of a star of @xmath7 @xcite . \n",
            " this is of astronomical interest in its own right as a model for a supernova progenitor , but also happens to represent a relatively simple and computationally efficient case , and has general implications for the convection process in all stars . \n",
            " three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of shell oxygen burning exhibit bursty , recurrent fluctuations in turbulent kinetic energy ( @xcite and below ) . \n",
            " the reason for this behavior has not been explained theoretically . \n",
            " these simulations show a damping , and eventual cessation , of turbulent motion if we artificially turn off the nuclear burning @xcite . \n",
            " further investigation @xcite shows that nearly identical pulsations are obtained with a volumetric energy generation rate which is constant in time , so that _ the cause of the pulsation is independent of any temperature or composition dependence in the oxygen burning rate . \n",
            " _ localized heating is necessary to drive the convection ; even with this time - independent rate of heating , pulses in the turbulent kinetic energy still occur .    such behavior is fundamentally different from traditional nuclear - energized pulsations dealt with in the literature @xcite. \n",
            " the most recent studies of turbulent turbulence in the presence of hydrogen @xcite and other hydrogen - induced turbulence have shown that the turbulent turbulence is not driven by thermal heating, but by the turbulent turbulence itself, and is driven by the turbulent turbulence itself. \n",

            "organic field - effect transistors ( ofets ) are the elementary building blocks of `` plastic electronics''.@xcite in these devices , charges are induced in a thin conducting channel at the interface between an organic semiconductor and a gate insulator . \n",
            " while commercial applications have already appeared , mostly based on low - cost organic thin - films , the fundamental physical mechanisms governing the charge dynamics in these devices are not fully understood . \n",
            " as it has become clear in recent years , even when high purity crystalline semiconductors are used in order to minimize the effects of structural and chemical disorder , the electronic characteristics of ofets are strongly affected by interactions taking place both within the semiconducting material as well as with its close environment . \n",
            " this can be traced back to the extremely narrow electronic bands resulting from the weak van der waals intermolecular bonding , that make organic semiconductors much more sensitive to electronic interactions than their inorganic counterparts . \n",
            " for this reason , polaronic effects have been shown to play an important role in these devices . \n",
            " several electron - lattice interaction mechanisms relevant to organic molecular crystals have been identified and studied in the past . \n",
            " these include holstein - like couplings to intra - molecular vibrations , leading to a local reorganization of the molecular energy levels@xcite as well as su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) or peierls - like couplings where the transfer integrals between the molecules are modulated by the inter - molecular motion.@xcite the latter mechanism couples directly the electronic motion to the strong lattice fluctuations arising from the mechanical softness of these compounds , and has been recently identified as the dominant limiting factor of the charge mobility in pure crystalline semiconductors . \n",
            " @xcite    in addition to such intrinsic mechanisms , interface - related effects have also been demonstrated in several systematic studies of organic fets using different gate dielectrics . \n",
            " sources of charge trapping have been identified , either related to the interface quality@xcite or to the long - range forces arising from polar impurities at the organic / dielectric interface . \n",
            " @xcite furthermore , it has been shown that the long - range polarization induced in high-@xmath0 gate materials by the charge carriers themselves can lead to self - trapping of the carriers . \n",
            " even when sufficient care is taken in order to minimize extrinsic sources of disorder , frhlich polarons are formed due to the polar long - range interaction of the carriers in the organic semiconductor with the phonons at the semiconductor / dielectric interface . \n",
            " the strength of this remote electron - phonon ( e - ph ) interaction can be tuned by an appropriate choice of the gate dielectric . \n",
            " the `` metallic - like '' carrier mobility characteristic of crystalline organic semiconductors can be converted into a much lower , thermally activated mobility.@xcite    while there is a vast theoretical literature dedicated to the different electron - lattice interaction mechanisms mentioned above , up to now there have been no attempts to study the interplay between bulk and interface e - ph couplings . to fill this gap , in this work \n",
            " we analyze a model that includes both bulk and interface effects as can be realized in organic fets , and treat them in a common framework . \n",
            " we focus on the combined effects of the ssh coupling of the electronic transfer integrals to the inter - molecular vibrations and of a frhlich long - range e - ph interaction as induced by the presence of the gate dielectric in a field - effect geometry . \n",
            " apart from its relevance to organic / dielectric interfaces , from the fundamental viewpoint this model presents an interesting combination of two _ a priori _ competitive mechanisms . \n",
            " our results show that a rather weak ssh coupling strength as estimated in refs . \n",
            " [ ] can have an unexpectedly strong effect in stabilizing a polaronic state when a moderate long - range polar coupling is present . \n",
            " therefore , self - trapped states of small radius can exist at common organic / dielectric interfaces , even in such cases where the carrier - interface phonon interaction alone would not be sufficient to produce polaronic self - localization @xcite . \n",
            " this provides a microscopic theoretical basis for the experimental results of ref . , where a finite activation energy indicative of self - trapped states was observed using gate materials such as al@xmath1o@xmath2 and ta@xmath1o@xmath3 . \n",

            "this paper is devoted to studying the stability of dynamical objects which are called by very different terms such as one - mode solutions ( omss )  @xcite , simple periodic orbits ( spos )  @xcite , low - dimensional solutions  @xcite , one - dimensional bushes  @xcite etc . \n",
            " below we refer to them as _ nonlinear normal modes _ ( nnms ) . \n",
            " let us comment on this terminology . \n",
            " the concept of similar nonlinear normal modes was developed by rosenberg many years ago  @xcite . \n",
            " each nnm represents a periodic vibrational regime in the conservative @xmath1-particle mechanical system for which the displacement @xmath2 of every particle is proportional to the displacement of an arbitrary chosen particle , say , the first particle [ @xmath3 at any instant @xmath4 : @xmath5 where @xmath6 are constant coefficients . \n",
            " note that convenient _ linear normal modes _ ( lnms ) also satisfy eq . \n",
            " ( [ eqch1 ] ) since , for any such mode , one can write @xmath7 where @xmath8 are constant amplitudes of individual particles , while @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the frequency and initial phase of the considered mode .    as a rule \n",
            " , nnms can exist in the mechanical systems with rather specific interparticle interactions , for example , in systems whose potential energy represents a _ homogeneous _ function with respect to all its arguments . \n",
            " however , in some cases , the existence of nnms is caused by certain symmetry - related reasons . \n",
            " we refer to such dynamical objects as _ symmetry - determined _ nnms .    in  @xcite \n",
            " , we have found all symmetry - determined nnms in all @xmath1-particle mechanical systems with any of 230 space groups . \n",
            " this proved to be possible due to the group - theoretical methods developed in  @xcite for constructing _ bushes _ of vibrational modes .    at this point \n",
            " , it is worth to comment on the concept of bushes of modes introduced in  @xcite ( the theory of these dynamical objects can be found in  @xcite ) .    in rigorous mathematical sense \n",
            " , they represent symmetry - determined _ invariant manifolds _ decomposed into the basis vectors of _ irreducible representations _ of the symmetry group characterizing the considered mechanical system ( `` parent '' group ) .    because of the specific subject of the present paper , it is sufficient to consider only bushes of vibrational modes in nonlinear monoatomic chains . \n",
            " such bushes have been discussed in  @xcite . \n",
            " let us reproduce here some ideas and results from these papers . \n",
            " every bush b@xmath11 $ ] describes a certain vibrational regime , and some specific _ pattern _ of instantaneous displacements of all the particles of the mechanical system corresponds to it . in turn , this pattern is characterized by a symmetry group @xmath12 ( in particular , such group can be trivial ) which is a _ subgroup _ of the symmetry group @xmath13 of the mechanical system in its equilibrium state . \n",
            " for example , let us consider the _ two - dimensional _ bush b@xmath14 $ ] in the monoatomic chain with periodic boundary conditions whose displacement pattern @xmath15 can be written as follows @xmath16 this pattern is determined by two time - dependent functions @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and the corresponding _ vibrational state _ of the @xmath1-particle chain is fully described by displacements inside the _ primitive cell _ , which is four time larger than that of the equilibrium state . \n",
            " we will refer to the ratio of the primitive cell size of the vibrational state to that of the equilibrium state as _ multiplication number _ \n",
            " ( @xmath19 ) and , therefore , for the pattern  ( [ eqch3 ] ) , one can write @xmath20 . \n",
            " the symmetry group @xmath21}$ ] of the bush b@xmath14 $ ] is determined by two _ generators _ : the translation ( @xmath22 ) by four lattice spacing ( @xmath23 ) and the inversion ( @xmath24 ) with respect to the center of the chain ( note that the condition @xmath25 must hold for existence of such bush ) . \n",
            " if we decompose the displacement pattern  ( [ eqch3 ] ) into the linear normal coordinates @xmath26\\right|n=1 .. n\\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & ( j=0 .. n-1),\\label{eqch10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we get the following form of\n",

            " , nnms can exist in the mechanical systems with rather specific interparticle interactions , for example , in systems whose potential energy represents a _ homogeneous _ function with respect to all its arguments . \n",

            " we refer to such dynamical objects as _ symmetry - determined _ nnms .    in  @xcite \n",

            "in the studies of spin glasses , much effort has been devoted either exprimentally or theoretically to the properties under magnetic fields . \n",
            " unfortunately , our understanding of them still has remained unsatisfactory@xcite . \n",
            " on theoretical side , most of the numerical studies have focused on the properties of the simple ising model , especially the three - dimensional ( 3d ) edwards - anderson ( ea ) model . while the existence of a true thermodynamic spin - glass ( sg ) transition has been established for this model in zero field , the question of its existence or nonexistence in magnetic fields has remained unsettled . this question is closely related to the hotly debated issue of whether the ordered state of the 3d ising sg in zero field exhibits a replica - symmetry breaking ( rsb ) or not . \n",
            " if one tries to understand real experimental sg ordering , one has to remember that many of real sg materials are more or less heisenberg - like rather than ising , in the sense that the random magnetic anisotropy is considerably weaker than the isotropic exchange interaction@xcite . \n",
            " for example , in widely studied canonical spin glasses , _ \n",
            " i.e. _ , dilute metallic alloys such as aufe , agmn and cumn , random magnetic anisotropy originated from the dzyaloshinski - moriya interaction or the dipolar interaction is often one or two magnitudes weaker than the isotropic rkky interaction . \n",
            " numerical simulations have indicated that the isotropic 3d heisenberg sg with finite - range interaction does not exhibit the conventional sg order at finite temperature in zero field @xcite . \n",
            " ( however , see also ref.@xcite . ) \n",
            " since applied fields generally tend to suppress the sg ordering , a true thermodynamic sg transition is even more unlikely under magnetic fields in case of the 3d heisenberg sg . \n",
            " experimentally , however , a rather sharp transition - like behavior has been observed under magnetic fields in typical heisenberg - like sg magnets , although it is not completely clear whether the observed anomaly corresponds to a true thermodynamic transition@xcite . \n",
            " the situation is in contrast to the zero - field case where the existence of a true thermodynamic sg transition has been established experimentally@xcite . \n",
            " set aside the question of the strict nature of the sg `` transition '' , it is experimentally observed that a weak applied field suppresses the zero - field sg transition temperature rather quickly . for higher fields , \n",
            " the sg `` transition '' becomes much more robust to fields , where the `` transition temperature '' shows much less field dependence @xcite . \n",
            " such behaviors of the sg transition temperature under magnetic fields @xmath0 were often interpreted in terms of the mean - field model @xcite . \n",
            " indeed , the mean - field sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model@xcite with an infinite - range heisenberg exchange interaction with weak random magnetic anisotropy exhibits a transition line similar to the experimental one @xcite , _ \n",
            " i.e. _ , the so - called de almeida - thouless ( at ) line@xcite @xmath1 in weak - field regime where the anisotropy is important , and the gabay - toulouse ( gt ) line@xcite @xmath2 in strong - field regime where the anisotropy is unimportant . nevertheless , if one notes that the true finite - temperature transition under magnetic fields , though possible in the infinite - range sk model , is unlikely to occur in a more realistic finite - range heisenberg model , an apparent success of the mean - field model in explaining the experimental phase diagram should be taken with strong reservation . \n",
            " thus , the question of the true nature of the experimentally observed sg `` transition '' under magnetic fields remains unsolved . \n",
            " recently , one of the present authors has proposed a scenario , the spin - chirality decoupling - recoupling scenario , aimed at explaining some of the puzzles concerning the experimentally observed sg transition@xcite . in this scenario , _ chirality _ , which is a multispin variable representing the sense or the handedness of local noncoplanar spin structures induced by spin frustration , plays an essential role . as illustrated in fig.[fig - chiral ] \n",
            " , locally noncoplanar spin structures inherent to the sg ordered state sustain two energetically degenerate `` chiral '' states , `` right - handed '' and `` left - handed '' states , characterized by mutually opposite signs of the `` chiralities '' . here \n",
            " , one may define the local chirality by _ three _ neighboring heisenberg - like sg atoms, @xmath3, which are in the same orientation. \n",
            " the chirality of the heisenberg - like sg is defined as @xmath4, where @xmath5 is the number of heisenberg - like atoms in the system. \n",
            " the chirality of the heisenberg - like sg is @xmath6, which is the number of heisenberg - like atoms in the system. \n",
            " the chirality of the heisenberg - like sg is @xmath7, which is the number of heisenberg - like atoms in the system. \n",

            " later , some theories have been proposed to describe multilayer adsorption in equilibrium @xcite . among them , the one of brunauer - emmett - teller ( bet ) @xcite and the one of frenkel - halsey - hill @xcite are the simplest which provide the basis to construct more elaborate approaches . \n",
            " those more elaborate analytic approaches take into account lateral interactions between the admolecules , differences between the energy of the first and upper layers , surface energetic heterogeneity and so forth . \n",
            " these leading models have played an important role in the characterization of solid surfaces by means of gas adsorption . \n",
            " a more accurate description of multilayer adsorption should account for the fact that , in practice , most adsorbates are polyatomic . \n",
            " even the simplest nonspherical molecules such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 may adsorb on more than one site depending on the surface structure @xcite . \n",
            " this effect , called multisite - occupancy adsorption , introduces a new complexity to the adsorption theory . \n",
            " the difficulty in the analysis of the multisite statistics is mainly associated with three factors which differentiate the @xmath2-mers statistics from the usual single - particle statistics . \n",
            " namely , @xmath3 no statistical equivalence exists between particles and vacancies ; @xmath4 the occupation of a given lattice site ensures that at least one of its nearest - neighbor sites is also occupied ; and @xmath5 an isolated vacancy can not serve to determine whether that site can ever become occupied . \n",
            " however , several attempts were done in the past in order to solve the @xmath2-mers problem . among them , onsager @xcite , zimm @xcite and isihara @xcite made important contributions to the understanding of the statistics of rigid rods in dilute solution . \n",
            " the fh theory , due independently to flory @xcite and to huggins @xcite , has overcome the restriction to dilute solution by means of a lattice calculation . \n",
            " the approach is a direct generalization of the theory of binary liquids in two dimensions or polymer molecules diluted in a monomeric solvent . \n",
            " it is worth mentioning that , in the framework of the lattice - gas approach , the adsorption of @xmath2-mers on homogeneous surfaces is an isomorphous problem to the binary solutions of polymer - monomeric solvent . \n",

            " @xcite presented a model to study the adsorption of linear adsorbates on homogeneous surfaces . \n",
            " the model is based on exact forms of the thermodynamic functions of linear adsorbates in one dimension and its generalization to higher dimensions . in the second , which is called the fractional statistical theory of the adsorption of polyatomics ( fsta ) , the configuration of the molecule in the adsorbed state is incorporated as a model parameter @xcite .    the treatments in refs . \n",
            " @xcite are limited in their application because they are valid only for monolayer adsorption . \n",
            " there are few studies that take into account multisite occupancy at the multilayer regime @xcite . \n",
            " aranovich and donohue @xcite presented a multilayer adsorption isotherm that should be capable to include multisite occupancy . \n",
            " later , a closed exact solution for the multilayer adsorption isotherm of dimers was reported in ref . \n",
            " it demonstrates that the determinations of surface areas and adsorption energies from polyatomic adsorbate adsorption ( also called @xmath2-mers ) may be misestimated , if this polyatomic character is not properly incorporated in the thermodynamic functions from which experiments are interpreted . \n",

            "einstein s train - embankment thought experiment ( tete ) , introduced in his popular book ` relativity , the special and general theory '  @xcite , first published in 1920 , has been used in many introductory textbooks and articles in the pedagogical literature  @xcite , to introduce the concept of ` relativity of simultaneity ' of special relativity ( sr ) before considering the space - time lorentz transformation ( lt ) .    since the complete relativistic interpretation of the tete depends both on direct physical consequences of the space - time lt the time dilatation effect and an understanding of the relativistic kinematics of photons as embodied in einstein s second postulate of sr , the possibility of introducing ` relativity of simultaneity ' in this simple way is illusory . \n",
            " this will become clear later in the present paper . \n",
            " however , as will be shown , a somewhat more sophisticated tete involving observers on the embankment and in two trains , with suitably chosen speeds , does indeed demonstrate the existence of a genuine relativity of simultaneity effect for certain events . \n",
            " in contrast , the correct relativistic analysis of einstein s original tete shows that the ` lightning strokes ' will be judged to be simultaneous by both the train and the embankment observers , in contradiction to einstein s conclusion . \n",
            " the fallacy in einstein s reasoning is simple to understand . \n",
            " if the experiment were to be performed with non - relativistic massive particles of constant velocity replacing photons , an analysis of the various space - time events could be performed in either the embankment or the train frames and would produce identical results . in the case of photons or massive relativistic particles , as shown explicitly in the example discussed in the appendix , this is no longer the case . \n",
            " then a correct analysis of events in the train frame requires that such events be specifically considered . \n",
            " this was not done in einstein s interpretation , where only events observed in the embankment frame were considered . \n",
            " the structure of the paper is as follows : in the following section , after a brief discussion of the simplest axioms which may serve as the basis for sr , two consequences of sr invariance of contiguity ( ic ) and the time dilatation ( td ) effect are derived . \n",
            " application of ic , td and einstein s second postulate of sr are sufficient for complete analyses of the tetes discussed in later sections of the paper . in particlar , \n",
            " explicit use of the space - time lt is not required . \n",
            " section 3 presents einstein s original tete and discusses it , and einstein s interpretation of it , in a critical manner . a similar experiment where photons are replaced by sound signals , either in the atmosphere or in the interior of the train \n",
            " , is also discussed . in section 4 a more elaborate tete with two trains and a well - defined procedure for synchronous production of light signals is described and analysed . \n",
            " it is shown that events corresponding to light signals , triggered by coincidence detection of two other light signals in different inertial frames , show a genuine relativity of simultaneity effect quite distinct from the one proposed by einstein . \n",
            " section 5 contains a discussion of the distinction between ` relative velocity ' and ` speed ' as applied in the tete as well as the closely related operational meaning of einstein s second postulate . \n",
            " the latter is also shown to be a direct consequence of the relativistic kinematics of massless particles  @xcite . \n",
            " section 6 contains a detailed discussion of a recent paper by nelson  @xcite that gives a re - interpretation of einstein s tete . \n",
            " nelson finally makes the same fundamental mistake , mentioned above , of attempting an analysis of the problem purely in terms of embankment frame events , although earlier in the paper came close to the correct solution of the problem . \n",
            " this was rejected due to a misapplication of ic to different events ( falsely assumed to be the same ) in the two frames . \n",
            " a summary and the conclusions of the present paper are to be found in section 7 . \n",
            " an appendix contains an analysis of the tete from a different point of view . instead of analysing light signals produced by the lightning strokes , \n",
            " the latter are replaced by pulsed laser beams in the embankment frame and the question of the simultaneity or non - simultaneity of the events where the laser pulses strike either the embankment at points aligned with the ends of the moving train , or the train itself , is considered in both the embankment and train frames . \n",
            " the results obtained demonstrate immediately the fallacy of einstein s embankment - frame - only interpretation of the tete. \n",
